        Comparing scars before dinner<br>
        Jump off the roof into the mirror<br>
        Felt like summer to my December<br>
        Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember<br>
        (Two, three, go)<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I know my temperature was set<br>
        You finally flew south<br>
        A bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic<br>
        At least I had it (uh) instead of never<br>
        Or maybe I'm too dramatic<br>
        (Two, three, go)<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now<br>
        My love's gone, my love's gone<br>
        My love's gone, oh, gone<br>
        (Two, three, go)<br>
        Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from<br>
        My love's gone, my love's gone<br>
        My love's gone, gone<br>
        Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I know love is all I got<br>
        I just hope to God she got the taste<br>
        Could put you on some shit you never seen<br>
        Could play a couple songs that you could dance to<br>
        I hope you know she can't compete with me<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Whether it′s rain or shine, I know I′m fine for now<br>
        My love's gone, my love's gone<br>
        My love's gone, oh, gone<br>
        Or maybe it′s just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from<br>
        My love's gone, my love's gone<br>
        My love's gone, gone<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        You kept me going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)<br>
        You kept me going, the Band-Aid is falling off now (keep)<br>
        You kept me going (gone, gone, gone), the Band-Aid is falling off now<br>
        Going, and now I'm scarred for life<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        My love is gone (gone), my love is gone (gone)<br>
        My love is gone (it's gone), my love is gone<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo<br>
        Emotion, feel Dumbo<br>
        Ask me where my love go<br>
        That bitch walked outside the front door<br>
        Knock, knock, knock, knock<br>
    </p>

        I'm not shocked, I brought this on me<br>
        It's my fault, you gon' leave lesson taught<br>
        See the weatherman told me that it was raining<br>
        My stupid ass brought umbrellas<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better<br>
        Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve<br>
        Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions<br>
        You got your thing, I got nothing but memories<br>
        I know your secrets, nigga<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that<br>
        E'rybody making a choice according to plan and<br>
        We had two different blueprints, but understood influence<br>
        You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit<br>
        You started building a bridge and turned it into a fence<br>
        Then my building got tore down all because of your new tenant<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease<br>
        You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it<br>
        But I finally found peace, so peace<br>
        (Want me do it over? Everything)<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit<br>
        It really does, it crushes your soul<br>
    </p>

        Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy<br>
        But I don't ever wanna fall in love again<br>
        Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, oh<br>
        But I don't ever want to fall in love again<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        (Got my eye)<br>
        I said go, go<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Thank you for the love, thank you for the joy<br>
        But I don't ever wanna fall in love again (again)<br>
        Thank you for the time, thank you for your mind, mind<br>
        But I don't ever want to fall in love again<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Again, again<br>
        Again, again, again, again<br>
        (Got my eye)<br>
    </p>
